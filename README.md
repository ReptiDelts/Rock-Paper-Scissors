# Rock-Paper-Scissors
I have just got started with python, as in 3 days ago, and I decided to make a project. I searched up online a module to randomise, and ended up using randint. It's super simple, and I'm guessing is no where near the most effective way to make Rock, Paper, Scissors but for my first project, and only 30 lines of code, I'm quite proud.
