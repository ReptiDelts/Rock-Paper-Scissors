# Rock-Paper-Scissors
I have just got started with python, as in 3 days ago, and I decided to make a project. I searched up online a module to randomise, and ended up using randint. It's super simple, and I'm guessing is no where near the most effective way to make Rock, Paper, Scissors but for my first project, and only 30 lines of code, I'm quite proud.

The python file is the base code, which I used Visual studio code to make. 

Edit: After fixing bugs that arose through my rather lack luster coding (I've only been doing this for 3 days) and some help from a few searches. (I mainly did this with my own code, I searched up the random functionality, and a few bugs that I had to fix.) I think it's finally finished and complete. I had a good time making this for my first project, and can't wait to move onto future projects.

The player wins file makes it so the player always wins, no matter what.
The computer wins file makes it so the computer always wins, no matter what.
The normal file makes it like normal, and randomises the computers choice, like an actual game of rock, paper, scissors.
